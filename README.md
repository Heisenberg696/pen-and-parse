A content/text summarizer takes the digitalized text and summarizes it, ensuring that the text's main subject and background are properly conveyed. Essentially, the system would offer the following features:  Digitizing text from handwritten documents.  Summarizing text read from handwritten documents.  Allowing users to save summaries to pdf format.
